### About
Simple text based quest game written in Python as a final project in my IT-140 class.

In order to download and play this game you must have a Python interpreter installed on your machine.

### Future Update
I am planning on developing a web based front end to play this game in a browser. This will also allow me to practice my API building and front end skills.
